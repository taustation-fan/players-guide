# An Introduction to Tau Station

[Tau Station](https://alpha.taustation.space/) is a text-based online RPG set
in the future in space, in a post-catastrophic environment.

I (moritz) was a tester in the closed alpha testing phase, and want to document the
things I wished I knew before I started.

This document also contains corrections and contributions from Perleone,
Shadow, Dotsent and Ovid.

Note that Tau Station is under active development. Hence, parts of this
document might become outdated when the game changes.

## The Financial System

There are *credits* and *bonds*.

### Credits

Credits is everyday money that you can
earn pretty easily. With credits, you can pay for things such as hotel
rooms, public shuttles for inter-station travel, University courses, and weapons and armor. 

You can earn credits through

* successful career tasks
* selling items (for example found in the Ruins)
* daily career payments
* side jobs
* discreet work
* combat, followed by looting the opponent
* levelling up
* missions (though most missions don't pay well financially)

### Bonds

Bonds are harder to earn, and can be used to pay for things that make
playing easier or faster:

* VIP packs
* accelerating University courses
* premium clones
* bribing for extra rations
* boosting training
* faster release from the Brig (prison) and Sick Bay
* faster shuttle travel

This list is roughly sorted by utility. VIP packs and accelerated
University courses are a pretty good way to spend bonds, while I'd only
use bonds for fast shuttle travel if there was a very good reason.

You can obtain bonds in the following ways:

* you can buy them in the shop
* as a daily reward for your career level
* you can find bond packages in the Ruins
* sometimes, discreet/anonymous work has a small bonds reward
* if you level up to a new tier (if you reach levels 6 and 11),
  you get a bonds reward

## Stats and Focus

Whenever you try something, and the success is not a foregone
conclusion, you use up some of your *Focus*, and one of the five
*stats*: Strength, Agility, Stamina, Intelligence, Social.

### Stats Regeneration

Every five minutes, your Focus and stats automatically regenerate. The
rate of regeneration is higher if:

* you are currently a VIP
* you are "well fed" from consuming a ration earlier
* you are in your hotel room
* you have completed one of the "Anatomy" University courses, available
  on the Nouveau Limoges station

Regeneration might be slightly faster if you stay longer in your hotel room.

Regeneration is slower if you are confined to the Sick Bay or the Brig.

Consuming a VIP package or a ration and levelling up immediately
regenerates your stats and focus full. (With rations, the regeneration
is only complete if the ration is of the same tier as yourself).

The following recovery rates have been compiled by mostly [Shadow and Dotsent](https://alpha.taustation.space/forum/discussions/topic/197-04-88-143-please-use-this-thread/post/197-53-01-501-stat-recovery):

|Booster                               | Focus/%   | Stats/% | Measured   |

### Stats Improvement

Most stations (all except the jump gates) feature a Gym, where you can
invest focus and current stat values to train the physical stats
(*strength*, *agility*, *stamina*).

You can train *intelligence* in a similar fashion in a hotel room of an
Inn, or at a University (scroll to the very bottom of the page). Most
stations (all except the jump gates and Moissan) have an Inn, and four
stations have a University (Tau, Nouveau Limoges, Moissan, Spirit of
Botswana).

You can also train intelligence while traveling with public shuttles.

The *social* stat can be trained at the Lounge that belongs to an inn.

The efficiency of training of any of these stats depends on the station.
In general, higher-level stations yield better training benefits. For
example on Tau Station (level 1), you get about a 0.004 stats increase
for every 10% of focus that you invest. On Yards of Gadani (level 10),
the stat increase is around 0.019.

Training can lead to injury (and thus unconsciousness or time at the
Sick Bay) if your stats are too low. Each gym has a minimal sum of
combined physical stats that you need to avoid injury, starting with 30
at Tau Station and going up to 39 at Bordeaux and Yards of Gadani.
Similar limits (though not explicitly denoted) apply to training of the
social and the intelligence stat.

Stats can also randomly increase as a bonus of successfully completed
anonymous work.

## Rations

You can survive without explicit use of rations. But, each time you
consume a ration, it immediately fills up all of your stats and your
Focus. 

If you consume a ration of a tier one lower than your character's, the
immediate regeneration is incomplete. A ration two tiers below your
current tier does not give any immediate regeneration.

Rations also give you the "well fed" status for 32 segments (roughly 8
hours), which increases stats and Focus regeneration. For rations of a
lower tier, the "well fed" status is shorter (10 segments for a tier
difference of two).

You are automatically assigned one ration per day, which you can fetch
at any station's Government Center. You can sometimes find rations in
the Ruins, and sometimes they are awarded as the random reward for doing
discreet work. Rations are also often the reward of successful combat
following random encounters in the Ruins.

Finally, you can spend bonds as bribes for more rations, though the
price doubles each time you do it in one day, and drops back to the
original price (20 bonds) at midnight.

## What To Do

As in every RPG, there are several different things you can do, with
different resource requirements and payoffs.

### Missions

Missions are fun! You can find a mission by clicking on the "Find a
mission" link in the "Employment" box. A mission opportunity is marked
by the orange action flag, either in an area or next to person.

During missions, you typically invest focus and some stats. After you
have finished the missions on Tau Station, you must travel to other
stations to find missions, and those missions might again prompt you to
other stations, which costs you credits (and there are missions that
require at least three interstellar travels). Also, sometimes bribing
somebody with your own credits is the easiest way to convince an NPC to
collaborate.

Missions give you a small financial reward, and typically the largest
experience reward that is available in the whole game. But most
importantly, missions are interactive short stories that are enjoyable
to read and experience.

### Ruins Scavenging

Most stations have a *Ruins* area, where you can scavenge for discarded
treasures. Each search costs 10% stamina, and if you find something,
also 10% of focus (15% of focus if you are VIP). Each successful find
also adds to your experience.

The things you can find in the ruins include (in decreasing likelihood):

* nothing
* common trade goods (sell for less than 1 credit)
* weapons
* armor
* bond packages
* VIP packs
* rare trade goods (sell for 5000 credits or more)

You can carry around what you find, up to a certain mass limit. If you
carry around too much, you will get a warning that you are encumbered,
and lower success rates for tests against the physical stats, and moving
to a different area of the station reduces the physical stats.

If you are at 100% encumbered, you will be losing 10% of each of the
physical stats with every move to the different area of the station.
If one of your physical stats reaches 0 because of encumbrance, you will
lose consciousness and be taken to Sick Bay (you may even die if the station
does not have a Sick Bay!), so try to offload heavy items at the first 
opportunity.

If you don't want to carry around stuff, you can sell it (go to Market
-> Vendors and then to your Inventory), store it (go to Market -> Storage,
buy storage if you haven't yet and then to your Inventory), or drop them
right from the Inventory.

### Random Encounters in the Ruins

In the Ruins you can also search for random encounters. Each search costs
5% Agility and Stamina each. When you find somebody, you can engage in
combat with them (but you don't have to do so immediately; you can, for
example, consume a ration or even retire to your hotel room first for
some stats replenishment).

Upon finding an opponent in the Ruins, you have 8 segments to fight them.

When you win such a fight, you can loot the opponent, which tends to give
you on the order of 1 to 50 credits, and you gain a reward. The reward
is often a ration, but it can also be a piece of armoury or a weapon.

You also gain experience from victorious combat, more so than from career
tasks or side jobs.

After finding an opponent, you cannot engage in another random encounter
for the next 8 segments.

### Pursue a Career

You can and should pursue a career. Performing career tasks is the most
reliable source of credits, and once you have been promoted a few times,
the only reliable in-game source of bonds.

#### Choosing Your Career

When I picked my career, I read through the descriptions, and picked the
one that sounded best. You should be more strategic in your choice.

The first factor you should consider is the primary and secondary stat
associated with the career task. You should favor a career that makes
use of Intelligence, because in the context of University courses, it
makes sense to boost that stat anyway.
All else being equal, you should avoid careers whose tasks make heavy
use of stamina, so that you can use your stamina to rummage in the
Ruins.

The second factor is availability. Career tasks can be tied to locations
(you can only repair ships at a Port, and only analyze security footage
at Security), and not all stations have all areas. Ports are everywhere,
Sick Bay, Cloning Vats, Brig and Security are also nearly ubiquitous.

Finally, some careers are more dangerous than others; if a majority of
tasks sound illegal, you might spend quite some time in the Brig.
(Though illegal tasks tend to pay much better than comparable legal
tasks).

Note that you can abort your career at any time, and even later return
to that career with no repercussions, except of course the time you
missed advancing your career.

#### Advancing Your Career

You advance your career by succeeding at career tasks. You go to
different areas of the station, and click on the "Tasks" tab, and then
attempt some tasks. Each success adds up to your career experience,
and each failure subtracts some amount.

Each night at GCT 0/0 (which coincides with midnight UTC on Auld Earth),
the number of days you spent in a career rank
increases. Once your career experience is high enough (whatever
that means) *and* you have spent enough days in the current career rank, you
are promoted. (If you fail enough tasks, you can also be demoted again).
Also at midnight you receive your regular payments of bonds and credits,
depending on your current career level.

The minimum number of career tasks increases exponentially: you can get
promoted after 2 days in career level 1, after 4 days in level 2, 8 days
in level 3 etc., all the way up to 128 days in level 7.

Career tasks use up 20% of the affected stat, and 5% focus. On success,
you get a bonus in credits, which is the primary source of most player's
credit wealth.

As your hidden career experience increases and/or you are promoted,
more difficult career tasks become achievable. In general, you should
try career tasks where your success rate is higher than 50%. If your
success rate is higher than 80% or 90%, you might try more difficult
tasks (which are those further down the list), because they yield higher
returns.

Another factor in the success rate of career tasks is the maximum value
of the stat that is tested. Training your strength makes it easier to
lift heavy stuff, right?

### Side Jobs

Side jobs are brief, one-off jobs that pay a fixed reward. They consist
of tests against the same stat until you have passed five of them. They
pay less than career tasks, but give you more experience.

The available side jobs and their pay depend on the station.

### Discreet Work

*Discreet Work* aka *Anonymous Missions* are automatically generated
missions that, on completion, give you a small amount of credits, and
more importantly, a random bonus. This bonus can be

* more credits
* an increase in one stat
* a weapon or armour
* a bond package
* a ration
* a VIP packs

In most cases, the potential rewards depends on the station level. For
example on Taungoo Station (level 5), the stats boost tends to be on the
order of 0.02, while you get something closer to 0.04 on Yards of Gadani
(level 10).

Completing discreet work also improves your reputation with the
affiliation of the government that controls the current station, which
in turn leads to shorter Brig times when you get caught doing something
illegal.

Some of the anonymous missions involve stealing an item from somebody,
and bringing it to somebody else. Between those two actions, the item
is in your own inventory, and you can steal it by aborting the mission.
The only repercussion is that after aborting an anonymous mission, you
won't be offered a new one for a while. For valuable items such as
rations, bond packages or VIP packs, this is usually worth it.

Despite the disclaimer of potential danger, Discreet Work has never
brought me into the Sick Bay or the Brig.

## University Courses

University courses can teach you handy skills. You have to pay some
credits to enroll in one, and can optionally spend bonds to speed them
up. The basic courses are relatively cheap and fast, while more advanced
courses take much longer, and can cost up to several ten thousand
credits.

You can only be enrolled in one course at a time, and you cannot abort a
course that you started.

In the beginning, you can likely only afford basic courses, so you
should enroll in those.

One module that can be generally recommended is the collection of
Anatomy courses available on Nouveau Limoges, since it boosts stats
recovery -- something that is useful no matter what career you pursue.

Having an above-average intelligence (as shown by the stats ranking on
your character page) makes courses faster.

The following modules are available, grouped by station:

* Tau Station (Sol)
    * Business: Bureaucracy
    * Combat: Combat Basics, Intermediate Combat, Defensive Tactics
    * Engineering: Basic Engineering
* Nouveau Limoges (Sol)
    * Engineering: Basic Engineering
    * Medicine: First Aid, Anatomy
    * Psychology: International Relations
* Moissan Station (Alpha Centauri)
    * Medicine: First Aid
* Spirit of Botswana (Alpha Centauri)
    * Combat: Combat Basics, Special Ops

## VIP Packs

VIP packs provide many benefits, documented
[here](https://taustation.space/blog/shop-grand-opening-next-steps/).
The most important ones are 150% focus, much faster stats regeneration, and
larger experience gains.

Playing with an active VIP pack is significantly more fun and more
efficient. When you first use one, all your stats go to 100%, so it
makes sense to exhaust your stats through career tasks or so before you
use one.

The following are sources of VIP packs:

* You can buy them in the shop
* You can buy a 3-day VIP pack every 7 days at the Market, for 290 bonds
* You can find VIP packs in the ruins
* Sometimes, the random reward for discreet work can be a VIP pack

## Travel

You can travel from station to station within a star system through
local shuttles. If you want to travel to a station in another star
system, you first need to travel to a jump gate, from there to the other
star system's jump gate, and from there to the station you want.

Travel depends on the distance between stations, which varies depending
on the current orbital positions.

You can't do anything except training intelligence during travels, but
stats and focus slowly regenerate. So before longer journeys, it makes
sense to use up your current stats for career tasks.

While planning your travel, be aware that hotel rooms cost more at
higher-level stations, and that shifting orbit positions can make the
travel back more expensive.

You need a Gaule visa for visiting stations under the Gaule government
(basically any station with French sounding names). As a VIP, you can
buy a Gaule visa at any station's Gov't center. Otherwise, you need to
buy it a Gaule Embassy on Tau Station (Sol) or Spirit of Botswana (Alpha
Centauri).

## Player and Station Levels

All players start from level 1, and gain experience through

* missions
* successful combat
* side jobs
* finding things in the Ruins
* career tasks
* discreet work

When you reach 100% experience of the current career level, you ascend
to the next level. On leveling up, you receive a small bonus in credits.

Each block of five levels is called a *tier*, and ascending to a higher
tier also gives a bonus of 500 bonds.

Leveling up also gives you access to more missions, which have minimal
player levels as prerequisites.

Stations have levels too. You can enter stations with a higher level
than your own player level, and perform career tasks, train in the gym,
train your intelligence in the hotel room, or social in the lounge,
provided that the relevant stat is high enough. You won't be able to
start missions, do discreet work or side jobs though.

Higher-level stations generally

* have higher yields for stats training
* tend to have higher limits for safe stats training
* let you find more valuable weapons and armor in the Ruins
* have more expensive hotel rooms
* have higher-paying side jobs and discreet work

All of these factors combined mean that, as long as you are not playing
missions, it makes sense to spend your time on higher-level stations.

## Combat

You can attack players and some NPCs, and other players can attack you.

Combat is turn-based, though in Player-vs-player combat, there are
timeouts for the turns. In combat mode, there is also a countdown
for when Security forces will likely arrive.

When you try to attack somebody, there is a chance that Security detains
you. The chance depends on the Orwellian level of the station (which you
can find in the Government Center), and the length of the stay in the
Brig depends on the law level. Tau Station is super paranoid, and you
can't ever attack somebody successfully there (possibly with the exception
of random encounters in the Ruins).

You can wear an armour suit, and equip up to two weapons. There are three
kinds of damage, Impact, Piercing and Energy. Weapons have an inherent
accuracy, and one or sometimes two kinds of damage they make. There is also
long range and shot range combat, and gun-like weapons are suited for long
range combat, while knifes and improvised weapons work in short range combat.

The success of an attack depends on the physical stats (mostly Stamina,
I think), the accuracy of the weapon, and combat skills (which can be
acquired through University courses).

A successful attack can damage the opponent's armor, and then wound the
opponent, which reduces a physical stat. Once a physical stat drops to
zero, the loser becomes unconscious, and can be looted by the winner.

On stations with a Sick Bay, the loser can then recover in the Sick Bay.
On stations without a Sick Bay, this can be the death of the character's
body. Which hopefully triggers the activation of a clone.

## Clones

*Note: this section is a bit conjectural, because I have not yet had the
need to activate a clone.*

A clone is an insurance against the death of a character's body. You can
buy a clone at the cloning facilities that are present on nearly all
stations.

The mental model behind a clone is that it is an inactive
duplicate of the character's body, and receives all experience and
knowledge as a constant feed from the active body. Once the active body
dies, the newest clone is activated. So the character keeps its
*intelligence* and *social* stats, but reverts back to the physical
stats of the clone.

There are currently three types of clones in the game: 3D-printed, vat-grown
and *Premium*. Even though most of the stations will have Clones facility,
not all of the stations provide all three types of clones.

3D-printed and vat-grown clones can be bought with credits, with the cost 
dependent on the player's level. The main differences between them are:
* 3D-printed clones are around 50% cheaper than vat-grown
* 3D-printed clones might experience mutations while created - meaning
that their stats have a chance to get lower than the original ones. You
can, however, purchase the *Positive mutation* perk for 20 bonds that will
actually make your 3D-printed clone "better" than original you!
* 3D-printed clones always have the same genotype as original. However,
if you purchase a vat-grown clone, you can select its genotype against
an additional payment of 20 bonds.

Both vat-grown and 3D-printed clones have a fixed gestation time of 100 segments,
which can be halved for 70 bonds.

*Premium* clones cost a flat rate of 99 bonds, and offer the advantage that
you can later update them to your current physical stats. You can spend 
20 bonds per clone to update them all to your current physical stats.

The gestation time of a *premium* clone is 200 segments and can be halved for
additional 99 bonds.

# Tactics, Strategy and Advice

Some random bits of advice on how to make the most of out Tau Station:

* Play the missions for fun and profit!
* Pick a career that doesn't have Stamina as primary or secondary stat (Medicine or Special Ops)
* Use your Stamina to search for valuable things in the Ruins. Despite what it says in the area descriptions, the Ruins are not (yet?) dangerous (except for other players attacking you, which can happen in other areas too).
** Equip the best weapons and armor that you find
** Store or sell the rest, depending on how badly you need the money
* As soon as you have reached level 3, strive to spend most of your time on higher-level stations; training your stats is more efficient there, and you find more valuable things in the ruins. 
* When you are not actively playing, spend your time in a hotel room, which speeds up stats and focus regeneration, and keeps you save from attacks.
* Missions, Discreet Work and training your stats require more Focus than career tasks and ruins scavenging; so if you are on VIP packs occasionally, do the first-mentioned kinds of things preferably while on VIP, and focus on your career and ruins searching while not a VIP.
* The Sol Jump Gate has a mission ("The Sleepless Ship") that takes you
  to Alpha Centauri, so only engage in that mission when you are ready
  to travel to Alpha Centauri (level 7, most stats at 12 or more; and at
  least 2000 credits, since an interstellar jump costs around 1800
  credits, and then you might need to travel to another station before you
  can earn much money).
* Only bother with clones after you have put significant effort into
  training physical stats.
* If you can, avoid illegal career tasks on Gaule-affiliated stations,
  since they punish foreigners harsher than the Consortium punishes
  their own citizens.

# Planned Features

From the [official blog](https://taustation.space/blog/), twitter and statements
from the Tau Station team, it seems that at least the following major features
are planned:

* The ability to purchase *private ships*, and use them for travel.
* The *Electronic Market*, which enables selling items to other players.
* *Crafting* items, which makes sense if you need something to sell.
* Player *Syndicates*, cooperations of players that conduct business together.
* Another star system, *Bernard's Star*, with brand new stations.
* Prerequisites and Perks for career levels.
* Modifications (*mods*), implanted electronic devices that modify attributes of the body.
* More missions and artwork.
* Extension to the random encounters in the Ruins.
